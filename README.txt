RouteOne v1.03c, by HRoll

README

To use RouteOne, execute the .jar file with a proper config.ini file. To run this, you will need Java 7 (http://www.java.com/en/download/win8.jsp?locale=en). Make sure you have a proper route file whose filename is given under the appropriate option in the config file. To read your output, simply open the text file whose filename you specified in the config file.

Also, when reading your output, be sure to check the top of the file. Any error messages will be displayed there (the lines with errors are simply ignored, and this may cause you to miss important lines).

For more detailed instructions, see doc.txt.

Feel free to give me questions, comments, suggestions, or bug reports on the SRL irc (irc.speedrunslive.com, my nick is HRoll) or by email at im.hroll@gmail.com.

Many thanks to SpeedRunsLive (SRL) for being an awesome place, and to Mountebank for getting me interested in this game. He also helped me test out this program, and used it actively during its early stages, so you can blame him for any errors. :)
