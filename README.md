Fork of HRoll's RouteOne with changes mainly by Dabomstew (in April 2014) and entrpntr (more recently). Don't expect route files to 100% reflect the most up-to-date strats, as strats are always changing. Create an issue on Dabomstew/poke-router to send in a bug report, the original author is no longer active.


ORIGINAL README (HRoll)

To use RouteOne, execute the .jar file with a proper config.ini file. To run this, you will need Java 7 (http://www.java.com/en/download/win8.jsp?locale=en). Make sure you have a proper route file whose filename is given under the appropriate option in the config file. To read your output, simply open the text file whose filename you specified in the config file.

Also, when reading your output, be sure to check the top of the file. Any error messages will be displayed there (the lines with errors are simply ignored, and this may cause you to miss important lines).

For more detailed instructions, see doc.txt.
